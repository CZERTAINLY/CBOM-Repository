# CBOM-Repository

The CBOM Repository service acts as an object storage wrapper built on top of an S3-compatible backend.
It provides a convenient REST API for uploading, retrieving, and searching Cryptographic Bills of Materials (CBOM) documents.

## Status Work In Progress

This project is currently under active initial development.

* You can explore the current REST API design at [OpenAPI Spec](`api/openapi.yaml`).
* To run the service locally, see the development guide [here](DEV.md).
